This is an OpenWRT feed that allows you to build the nodewatcher telemetry
software on your OpenWRT node.

This is part of the Nodewatcher project:
  https://github.com/interop-dev/nodewatcher

Nodewatcher is a management interface for wireless/community mesh networks.
These telemetry packages allow mesh nodes to push data to the central database.

To use this feed, get a copy of OpenWRT, from here:
  https://openwrt.org/

Then, edit your feeds.conf, and add this line:
  src-git nodewatcher git://github.com/interop-dev/nodewatcher-telemetry.git

Then, run ./scripts/feeds install -a

Now, you can build OpenWRT, through the standard method, documented here:
  http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/toolchain

When you do "make menuconfig", you will be able to choose
  Utilities -> Nodewatcher -> Nodewatcher
